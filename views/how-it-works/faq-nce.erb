<h5>How often is the Study Guide updated?</h5>

<p>The Study Guide is constantly monitored for updating based on curriculum changes, changes to the NCE, and feedback from students. When new material becomes known, it is added to the Study Guide. Frequently this is done at least once or twice a year.</p>



<h5>How soon will the Study Guide arrive after I purchase it?</h5>

<p>For those who purchase the Study Guide hard copy by credit card, we ship the next business day after the card is successfully processed. CTC also accepts payment by check or money order, though this can delay the shipping process.</p>

<h5>Do I get my money back if I do not pass?</h5>

<p>We do have a Money Back Pass Guarantee policy (see NCE page).</p>



<h5>What is the NCE pass rate for those who purchase the Study Guide?</h5>

<p>We do not know every customer's pass/fail history, but we do know that based on the percentage of customers who request their money back based on our Pass Guarantee, our customer's pass rate is 97%. Clearly those using the Dr. Arthur Study Guide to prepare perform above the national pass rate (72%) for the NCE. Many customers call or write to us of their success. We'd love to hear your <a href="/feedback">feedback</a> as well!</p>



<h5>Does Dr. Arthur offer live preparatory seminars as well?</h5>

<p>Yes - Dr. Arthur has conducted over 100 two-day seminars designed to provide you with in-person instruction that will help you pass the NCE. The seminars are held a few times a year, usually in the Southeast region. For more information or to make reservation, visit Dr. Arthur's site at <a href="http://arthurnceworkshop.com">arthurnceworkshop.com</a>.</p>



<h5>Is Dr. Arthur's Study Guide enough, or do I need additional textbooks to study?</h5>

<p>The answer depends on how familiar you with the material in the Study Guide. Feedback from customers indicates that for recent graduates, the Study Guide is a sufficient resource that is both comprehensive in scope, while also concise in covering likely concepts that will be covered on the NCE.</p>

<p>If you have been out of your program of study 5-10 years, additional material may be helpful. Just be careful not to overwhelm yourself with too much material.</p>



<h5>What is the best way to use Dr. Arthur's Study Guide to study for the NCE?</h5>

<p>We recommend completing the Pre-Assessment Exam in the Study Guide first to help you evaluate your strengths and weaknesses, and then, based on those results, decide what other material might be helpful. It is smart to prioritize your study time by focusing on terms, names, and ethics. Other suggestions:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Locate a study partner.</li>
		<li>Attend a live preparatory seminar.</li>
		<li>Take one chapter to work with you.</li>
		<li>Take the Practice Examinations. They are built like the NCE. Frequently, manual purchasers provide me feedback which indicates that the pre-assessment examination and the Practice Examinations are more difficult than the actual NCE, so if you pass those, you should do well.</li>
	</ul>
