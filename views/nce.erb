I used your e-study guide and online exams with two other study resources, and your materials were by far the most helpful and comprehensive. I can safely say I was well-prepared, and I will highly recommend your program to others.

Not only did I pass it on my first attempt, but I scored 124 when I only needed 91 to pass! Utilizing the study guide along with the 3 practice exams helped build my confidence. The study guide was easy to follow and allowed me to focus on one concept at a time. I am very grateful for CounselorExams.com's study materials; it was well worth the investment!

				<img style="height: 18px; opacity: 0.6;" src="img/quote-open.png"/> &nbsp;Gary Arthur's Study Guide is the single most powerful tool anyone can use to prepare for the NCE. The material is extremely well organized and accessible, the text is highly readable, and the information is precisely focused on what you need to know.  Gary's study guide helped me develop a successful test-taking strategy and gave me a clear approach for studying for the exam. The practice examinations gave me an effective chance to test my knowledge. I recommend this study guide to all the students and associate clinicians I supervise.
