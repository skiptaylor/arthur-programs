				<h3>Exam Format Instructions</h3>
				<br />
				<p>The Exam Format scenarios will be introduced with a <strong>Summary</strong> of the client's initial statement or chief complaint. Read each summary carefully.</p> 
				<p>As the counselor, you must then work through appropriate questions and gather the information necessary to formulate a diagnosis and treatment plan.</p> 
				<p>As you answer each question, note that most have more than one answer that will provide important information. These answers will <strong>positively affect your score</strong>, so it is best to select as many positive answers as possible. Other answers will not be helpful, and thus will <strong>negatively affect your score</strong>. Still other answers will be neutral. You will find out the score associated with each answer at the end of the scenario.</p> 
				<p>Part of the critical thinking evaluation is for you to determine which answers are important. A response is displayed immediately upon choosing an answer.</p> 
				<p><strong>Important:</strong> each scenario contains a diagnosis <strong>Stop question</strong>. After initial information gathering questions, sufficient information will have been provided for you to make a correct diagnosis.</p> 
				<p>For the Stop question, you will be instructed not to go forward until a correct diagnosis is made. For some scenarios, you may be instructed to find a second or third diagnosis before going to the next question. A recommended treatment question usually follows the diagnosis question. When dual or multiple diagnoses are identified, the treatment question should be answered with treatments for all identified diagnoses.</p>
