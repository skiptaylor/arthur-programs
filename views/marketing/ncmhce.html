			<p>
				&ldquo;I can't imagine taking the licensure exam without having used the <strong>Arthur-Brende NCMHCE Scenario Simulator</strong> materials to study. I highly recommend it to others preparing for the NCMHCE!&rdquo;
			</p>
			<small>Mindy Parsons</small>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I want to thank you for your great customer service and support. I passed! The scenarios were especially helpful, and I was very pleased with the package overall. A very good use of my money - it was worth it! I will recommend your program to my peers.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<small>Debbie M.</small>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I am a licensed professional and have taken lots of other exams. The NCMHCE is by far the most difficult exam I have taken. If it wasnâ€™t for your material and excellent assistance, I would not have passed my NCMHCE exam and received my state license. Other study material sites are not as professional or helpful as yours.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<small>S. Winkelmann</small>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				&ldquo;The scenarios were very helpful as this was not the type I had in my course work. I had to change my way of thinking to take the examination. Dr. Arthur's Study Guides are excellent resources.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				&ldquo;I am recommending the <strong>Arthur-Brende NCMHCE Scenario Simulator</strong> to everyone. It was like the actual exam, and very thorough.&rdquo;

			<p>
				&ldquo;I just received word that I passed the NCMHCE! I previously took the test twice and failed twice. I had studied with another company's materials. I just did not understand what they were asking me to do. But by studying with your scenarios, I was able to see the pattern, understand the structure of the test and apply all the knowledge I had. Your examples and explanations of your scoring made it clear why some choices were not acceptable. Thanks for your wonderful web site and your personal service. It made all the difference and I went in feeling completely confident. I passed both sections with 30 more points than I actually needed!&rdquo;
			</p>
			<small>Jane Pitts</small>

		<blockquote>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I passed the NCMHCE yesterday and I couldn't have done it without Dr. Arthur's Study Guide and the practice simulations. The way the study guide tied everything together (diagnosis, treatment planning, counseling interventions, and psychological testing) was incredibly helpful and the simulations assisted me in learning how to take the test. Thanks for your help.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<small>Penny Minor</small>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>&ldquo;Just wanted to let you all know that I took the NCMHCE today... and passed on my first attempt. Your full package of scenarios was VERY helpful in preparing for the exam. In fact, they were more difficult...which made the test seem relatively easy in comparison. Thanks again... and have a good holiday season.&rdquo;</p>
