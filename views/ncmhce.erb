				<p>
					&ldquo;I wanted to let you know how grateful I am for the help of the counselor exams study guide. I passed my NCMHCE with flying colors and I truly have this study guide and online simulations to thank! I was able to really target the material that I needed a refresher on but also affirm the things that I was doing right. I have told all of my friends that are preparing for the exam that this is the best. I will also continue to reference the material covered in this study guide throughout my career!&rdquo;
				</p>
				<small>Sherese Ezelle</small>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					&ldquo;I used the 37 scenario package and I passed on my first try. In my view, I did not have to put in an inordinate amount of time and effort into studying because number one, I did have my foundation down already, and two, this course helped me to see how the test operated. Without that information, I think I would have failed. The course familiarizes one with the format, teaches one to not do "too much" in the scenarios and certainly not to make random guesses, and third, the course helps one to familiarize oneself with various testing instruments. (At least I knew some names to look up.) I felt that the course made studying very palatable, considering I was under stress already and I did not have a lot of extra time and energy for this. I would recommend this course.&rdquo;

				<small>Amy</small>

			<blockquote>
				<p>
					&ldquo;I passed with flying colors, no small part due to the preparation I received from both the study guide and particularly the scenarios. I would highly recommend using this program to all who seek to pass this exam. Thanks!&rdquo;

				<small>M.R.</small>

			<blockquote>
				<p>
					&ldquo;Without Dr. Arthur's course and materials there was no way that I would pass one of the most important exams of my career. The sheer variety of practice scenarios and information included in the booklet give you all that you need to get a real feel for how the NCMHCE is presented and the information that you need to know to pass. Additionally Dr. Arthur makes himself available to you personally via phone and email and I cannot say enough about him as a person. He is kind, generous and very much wants to see people succeed. When I called him to tell him I passed he was elated and said that my scores were some of the highest he has ever seen. Great praise for someone who was freaking out days before the exam!&rdquo;

					&ldquo;Dr. Arthur, I just wanted to thank you and let you know that I passed my licensing exam on Friday. Your tutorial program is absolutely the best study program on the market. I really enjoyed talking with you this past week and the tips you provided boosted both my morale and my score! Thanks again for this great review program!&rdquo;

				<p>
					&ldquo;Great study course that prepped me within three months. The study supplement is so informative that I'll be keeping it on my library shelf as a reference. The scenarios, I believe, were the greatest asset with built-in tutorials. I can see now why Dr. Arthur provides a money-back guarantee. If you complete the scenarios and reference the supplement, you WILL pass! (And not just by the skin of your teeth.)&rdquo;

					&ldquo;Thank you so much, Dr. Arthur! On 12/12/2013 I passed the NCMHCE exam on the first attempt using Dr. Arthur's study program. The online practice scenarios were priceless. The program is affordable and the study guide provides a wealth of information that I will continue to use in my practice as a source of valuable information.&rdquo;

I used several study materials but feel your materials were the best and most closely approximated the actual exam.  I felt my money was well spent on the Arthur-Brende study materials.  I will recommend these materials to others who study for the exam.  The study materials that summarized diagnoses with symptoms, typical assessments, appropriate treatments and differential diagnoses were especially helpful.&rdquo;

I just did not understand what they were asking me to do. But by studying with your scenarios, I was able to see the pattern, understand the structure of the test and apply all the knowledge I had. Your examples and explanations of your scoring made it clear why some choices were not acceptable. Thanks for your wonderful web site and your personal service.

Your advice was very helpful in approaching the exam.  There were a few scenarios on there that didn't get much focus in your simulations, but there were others that I was more confident with due to what I learned in the simulations, and I was able to use the test-taking strategies we discussed to get through the ones I was somewhat uncertain on.&rdquo;
