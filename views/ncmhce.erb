				<img style="height: 18px; opacity: 0.6;" src="img/quote-open.png"/> &nbsp;I passed the NCMHCE this morning! I'm ecstatic! The study manual as well as the practice scenarios were a massive contribution to my success! Thank you!

			<p>
				<img style="height: 18px; opacity: 0.6;" src="img/quote-open.png"/> &nbsp;Just wanted to take a few moments to say thank you for easing the anxiety and stress associated with this test. I took it twice but came a few points shy the first time and aced it the second time. The examples in the practice tests were consist with the test material and allowed me to feel more confident and prepared. The workshop was also a great tool and I am glad to have had that as an option; as it provided me the opportunity to ask you specific questions. Thanks for your patience on the call and I am so excited to be celebrating as a newly licensed therapist!

				<img style="height: 18px; opacity: 0.6;" src="img/quote-open.png"/> &nbsp;I can say, and feel free to quote me, that nothing, in all my preparation, helped me more than the consultation with Dr. Arthur. It was the added value distinctive to your program that made all the difference. With just a short time to prepare, I bought a number of the resources that were available online, but I was still feeling very overwhelmed. The study guide helped to narrow down what I needed to focus upon, the simulated Exams helped me to become familiar with both the test format and the rationale behind the answers, but the consultation is what helped the most. Having explored the options available, it is by far the best deal out there to prepare for the NCMHCE!

			<p>
				<img style="height: 18px; opacity: 0.6;" src="img/quote-open.png"/> &nbsp;I passed!! Without this study program, I would have failed... This program is the best. I really think your supplement should be a college book... Definitely uses examples from real-life and similar to the test. I never write these things, but was really excited and amped up to report how helpful this guide truly is. Your guide will continue to help me as I practice.

Had I not purchased your program I don't think the outcome would be the same. It was my first time sitting for the exam and I'm so grateful to have passed on the first try.

				<img style="height: 18px; opacity: 0.6;" src="img/quote-open.png"/> &nbsp;This study guide and the simulations were amazing and were truly the backbone of my preparation for the NCMHCE. I am now independently licensed and owe a great deal to Dr. Arthur's preparation materials. Worth the investment and then some. Wouldn't recommend taking the exam without making this purchase!

I passed my NCMHCE with flying colors and I truly have this study guide and online simulations to thank! I was able to really target the material that I needed a refresher on but also affirm the things that I was doing right. I have told all of my friends that are preparing for the exam that this is the best. I will also continue to reference the material covered in this study guide throughout my career!

			<p>
				<img style="height: 18px; opacity: 0.6;" src="img/quote-open.png"/> &nbsp;I used the 37 scenario package and I passed on my first try. In my view, I did not have to put in an inordinate amount of time and effort into studying because number one, I did have my foundation down already, and two, this course helped me to see how the test operated. Without that information, I think I would have failed. The course familiarizes one with the format, teaches one to not do "too much" in the scenarios and certainly not to make random guesses, and third, the course helps one to familiarize oneself with various testing instruments. (At least I knew some names to look up.) I felt that the course made studying very palatable, considering I was under stress already and I did not have a lot of extra time and energy for this. I would recommend this course.

The sheer variety of practice scenarios and information included in the booklet give you all that you need to get a real feel for how the NCMHCE is presented and the information that you need to know to pass. Additionally Dr. Arthur makes himself available to you personally via phone and email and I cannot say enough about him as a person. He is kind, generous and very much wants to see people succeed. When I called him to tell him I passed he was elated and said that my scores were some of the highest he has ever seen. Great praise for someone who was freaking out days before the exam!

Your tutorial program is absolutely the best study program on the market. I really enjoyed talking with you this past week and the tips you provided boosted both my morale and my score! Thanks again for this great review program!

				<img style="height: 18px; opacity: 0.6;" src="img/quote-open.png"/> &nbsp;Great study course that prepped me within three months. The study supplement is so informative that I'll be keeping it on my library shelf as a reference. The scenarios, I believe, were the greatest asset with built-in tutorials. I can see now why Dr. Arthur provides a money-back guarantee. If you complete the scenarios and reference the supplement, you WILL pass! (And not just by the skin of your teeth.)

On 12/12/2013 I passed the NCMHCE exam on the first attempt using Dr. Arthur's study program. The online practice scenarios were priceless. The program is affordable and the study guide provides a wealth of information that I will continue to use in my practice as a source of valuable information.

I used several study materials but feel your materials were the best and most closely approximated the actual exam.  I felt my money was well spent on the Arthur-Brende study materials.  I will recommend these materials to others who study for the exam.  The study materials that summarized diagnoses with symptoms, typical assessments, appropriate treatments and differential diagnoses were especially helpful.

The NCMHCE is by far the most difficult exam I have taken. If it wasn&#39;t for your material and excellent assistance, I would not have passed my NCMHCE exam and received my state license. Other study material sites are not as professional or helpful as yours.

I needed lots of repetition of just doing the exam over and over so that I could understand what they were looking for. I took the NCMHCE the first time without your materials and failed. I took it the second time after studying a lot with your materials, any my scores went up over 25 points. Your materials significantly helped.

I had studied with another company's materials. I just did not understand what they were asking me to do. But by studying with your scenarios, I was able to see the pattern, understand the structure of the test and apply all the knowledge I had. Your examples and explanations of your scoring made it clear why some choices were not acceptable. Thanks for your wonderful web site and your personal service. It made all the difference and I went in feeling completely confident. I passed both sections with 30 more points than I actually needed!

Thank you very much for your scenarios and for the time that you gave me on the phone.  Your advice was very helpful in approaching the exam.  There were a few scenarios on there that didn't get much focus in your simulations, but there were others that I was more confident with due to what I learned in the simulations, and I was able to use the test-taking strategies we discussed to get through the ones I was somewhat uncertain on.
